## SQL tasks

__Task: generate a table representing countriesâ€™ GDP for each year and their average gdp__

```sql

SELECT * FROM "CountryStats" LIMIT 10
SELECT * FROM "CountryRegions" LIMIT 10

--- 2. extract gdp for each year for each country
	
SELECT country_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) as year_, gdp 
FROM "CountryStats"
ORDER BY country_id, year_
	
 
--- 3. extract average gdp for each country for each year
SELECT 
	AVG(gdp) OVER (PARTITION BY country_id) as avg_gdp
FROM "CountryStats"

---4. solution (combine 2 and 3 into a single table)
SELECT country_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) as year_, gdp,
	AVG(gdp) OVER (PARTITION BY country_id) as avg_gdp
FROM "CountryStats"
